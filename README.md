Project Description:

“NagarTrack is a smart municipal grievance management platform that empowers citizens to seamlessly report civic issues like garbage, drainage, potholes, and streetlight failures. With real-time status tracking, data analytics, and ward-wise dashboards, it bridges the gap between the public and local authorities—ensuring faster resolution, improved transparency, and a cleaner, more responsive city.”
